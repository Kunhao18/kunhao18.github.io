Hi there! I'm a research engineer working on AI agent in the Huawei UK Research Centre and I'm currently looking for a PhD position about language and cognition.

I finished my master program MSc Speech and Language Processing at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I learnt concretly the theories and techniques about NLP, and more importantly, realized the potential in cognitive science. Before, I did a 4-year undergraduate study about computer science and intelligence science at the [Beijing University of Posts Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), where I acquired solid programming capabilities and foundation of AI theories. 

My research interest lies in <u>the human cognitive process</u>, <u>the interaction between cognition and language</u>, <u>and how to implement cognitive models computationally in AI system</u> to enhance its intelligence or make it more human-like, briging human and AI.
