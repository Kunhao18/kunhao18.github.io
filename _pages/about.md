Hi there! I'm a PhD student in the NLP group at the [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. Yulan He. My current focus is on developing innovative LLM-based systems that assist education, improving the interactivity, interpretability, and multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

I completed my MSc in Speech and Language Processing at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I gained a strong foundation in NLP and discovered a deep interest in cognitive science. Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Intelligence Science from the [Beijing University of Posts Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), where I built solid programming skills and a strong grounding in AI fundamentals.

My research interests lie in <u>efficient and effective human-computer interaction</u> and <u>cognition-inspired AI systems</u>, with a focus on exploiting the capabilities of intelligent agents. I’m passionate about building socially beneficial AI that bridges humans and machines through seamless, intuitive collaboration.
